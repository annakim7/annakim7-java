#Project Overview
A simulation of a city inhabited by mice and cats, modeling the interactions between these two types of creatures within a two-dimensional grid that represents the city.

#Simulation Details
Cats and Mice Behavior: Cats chase and eat mice. If a cat fails to consume enough mice, it will eventually die. Mice also have a limited lifespan and will pass away after a certain period.
City Environment: The simulation takes place within a city, depicted as a two-dimensional grid where both cats and mice move around freely.
Objective: The objective of the simulation is to observe the dynamics and interactions between the cats and mice over time, including the impact of predation and survival on their populations.
